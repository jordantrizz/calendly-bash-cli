## Project
* A bash script for interacting with the Calendly API to create and manage events, as well as to manage webhooks.
* The script allows users to create events, list events, create webhooks, and list webhooks using simple command-line commands.
* Always update CHANGELOG.md with each release.
* Always provide a git commit message after completing each task.

## Development Procedures
* When making a new version, update the version number in any relevant files.
* When generating git commit messages utilize the Conventional Commits specification for consistency https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
* When making a new release, the commit first line should be "Release vX.Y.Z" where X.Y.Z is the new version number and then the body can contain any relevant information about the release.
